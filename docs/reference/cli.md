# Command line interface

Installing the package provides a `swebench` command. Every command takes
`-h/--help`, and the top level takes `-v/--verbose`.

`DATASET` accepts an alias, a HuggingFace id, or a local path:

| alias | dataset |
|---|---|
| `full` | `SWE-bench/SWE-bench` |
| `verified` | `SWE-bench/SWE-bench_Verified` |
| `multimodal` | `SWE-bench/SWE-bench_Multimodal` |
| `multilingual` | `SWE-bench/SWE-bench_Multilingual` |

## Evaluate

### `swebench eval DATASET`

Run the reference patches or a model's predictions.

```bash
swebench eval verified --gold
swebench eval verified -p preds.jsonl --run-id gpt5 -j 16
swebench eval multimodal --gold -i carbon-design-system__carbon-10188
swebench eval full --gold --modal
```

Pass exactly one of `--gold` or `-p/--predictions`. `-i/--instance` is
repeatable, `-j/--workers` sets parallelism, `-t/--timeout` is per instance.

### `swebench report RUN_ID`

Recompute verdicts from a finished run's saved logs, without starting
containers. Useful after a log-parser fix, since the test output is already on
disk.

```bash
swebench report my-run -d verified
swebench report my-run -d multimodal -i grommet__grommet-6282
```

## Images

Images are built from a task repo: each task carries its own Dockerfile, and its
`task.yaml` names the image the dataset will tell the harness to pull. Narrow
with `-i`, which can name a task in an unpublished split.

```bash
swebench images build ~/swe-bench-tasks -j 8
swebench images build ~/swe-bench-multimodal-tasks -i carbon-design-system__carbon-10188
swebench images build ~/swe-bench-tasks --dry-run

swebench images check ~/swe-bench-tasks    # which images are missing from the registry
swebench images push  ~/swe-bench-tasks    # publish them, under the names task.yaml declares
swebench images clean --run-id my-run      # remove leftover containers
```

`images check` is worth running before a long evaluation: it catches a stale or
partially-pushed image set in seconds rather than one instance at a time.
`images push --dry-run` prints the exact `docker push` commands and stops.

## Datasets

A task repo holds one directory per instance:

```
sweb.yaml                    the dataset this repo publishes, and its splits
tasks/<instance_id>/
    task.yaml                metadata, including which split the task is in
    problem_statement.md     the issue text shown to a model
    gold.patch               the reference fix
    test.patch               the tests that grade it
    eval.sh                  the script the harness runs
    Dockerfile               the image it runs in
    assets/                  binary files a patch cannot carry
```

The tree is the source of truth. Nothing below reads HuggingFace to build the
dataset, so a new dataset can be developed entirely locally.

### `swebench dataset check TASK_REPO`

Check that a task repo is well formed: every task has its files, its metadata,
and a split registered in `sweb.yaml`. This runs automatically before building
or publishing, so a malformed tree is never published.

```bash
swebench dataset check ~/swe-bench-tasks
swebench dataset check ~/swe-bench-tasks --fix   # write back what the tree implies
```

`--fix` only writes what can be derived from the tree itself: the split list in
`sweb.yaml`, and image names that follow the naming convention. It never
invents data it cannot see.

### `swebench dataset build TASK_REPO`

Compile the repo into one parquet per split.

```bash
swebench dataset build ~/swe-bench-multilingual-tasks
swebench dataset build ~/swe-bench-tasks -o /tmp/parquets
```

### `swebench dataset diff TASK_REPO`

Show how the tree differs from the dataset it publishes, per column.

```bash
swebench dataset diff ~/swe-bench-multilingual-tasks
```

### `swebench dataset push TASK_REPO`

Overwrite the HuggingFace dataset named in `sweb.yaml`.

```bash
swebench dataset push ~/swe-bench-tasks --dry-run
swebench dataset push ~/swe-bench-tasks
```

A task whose split is not published, `deprecated` for example, stays in the tree
and can still be built by id, but never reaches the dataset.

### `swebench dataset collect REPOS...`

Scrape pull requests from GitHub into candidate task instances.

```bash
swebench dataset collect scikit-learn/scikit-learn
swebench dataset collect psf/requests --max-pulls 200 --cutoff-date 20230101
```

Versioning candidate instances is no longer part of this CLI. That tooling lives with
the task data, at [swe-bench-tasks/src/versioning](https://github.com/SWE-bench/swe-bench-tasks/tree/main/src/versioning).

## Older invocations

Every module is still runnable directly, with the same arguments as before:

```bash
python -m swebench.harness.run_evaluation --dataset_name ... --predictions_path ...
python -m swebench.image_builder.prepare_images --dataset_name ...
```

The inference utilities are not exposed through `swebench` and are run this way:

```bash
python -m swebench.inference.run_api --help
```
